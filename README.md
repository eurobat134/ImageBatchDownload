## How To Use
### **Yand.re**
</br>
Run The Yand.re.py file.
</br>
After that input you can input either the tag of ur choosing or the whole URL.

> Tag Example

>Whole URL Example

After inputting the URL the number of pages will be printed in the console and the teminal will ask you how how many pages u want to download.

You can answer with any number ranging from 1 to the maximum page number.

After that you will be asked about the quality if the images that u want to download since Yand.re has a 1080p version and a 4k+ version, so u can asnwer that question with either **hd** for HD resolution or **4k** - **8k** for the best resolution available.
### Why?
